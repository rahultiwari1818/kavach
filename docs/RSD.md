# Kavach â€“ Crime Reporting & Hotspot Mapping System

---

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 User Authentication & Authorization

- The system must provide **secure registration and login** functionality for:
  - **Citizens**
  - **Administrators**
- Enforce **role-based access control**:
  - Citizens have limited access to reporting and viewing.
  - Administrators have full access to crime management and verification.

### 1.2 Crime Reporting

- Citizens must be able to **report a crime** with the following details:
  - **Crime Type**
  - **Description**
  - **Location** (via GPS or manual address input)
  - **Optional Media Attachments** (images and/or videos)

### 1.3 Crime Management & Verification

- Administrators must be able to:
  - **View** reported crimes
  - **Verify**, **Approve**, or **Reject** reports
- Only **verified crimes** will:
  - Appear on the public map
  - Contribute to hotspot detection

### 1.4 Hotspot Detection & Visualization

- The system must:
  - Automatically **detect hotspots** based on geospatial clustering
    - A **hotspot** is defined as an area with **â‰¥10 crimes within a 1 km radius**
  - Display hotspots on an **interactive map**
    - Use **heatmap visualization** to show intensity of crime

---

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance & Scalability

- The system must support at least **1000 concurrent users** without performance degradation.
- **Geospatial clustering queries** must return results within **3 seconds**.

### 2.2 Security

- All sensitive data must be encrypted:
  - Use **bcrypt** for password hashing
  - Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for session management
- The platform must use **HTTPS** for all data transmissions to ensure security.

---

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Citizen

- As a **citizen**, I want to **register and log in securely**, so that I can access my account and report crimes.
- As a **citizen**, I want to **report a crime** with a description, type, and location, so that authorities can be informed quickly.
- As a **citizen**, I want to **upload images or videos** related to a crime, so that my report is more credible.
- As a **citizen**, I want to **view verified crime reports on a map**, so that I can stay informed about crime in my area.
- As a **citizen**, I want to **see hotspots highlighted on a map**, so that I can avoid high-risk areas.

### 3.2 Administrator

- As an **administrator**, I want to **log in with elevated access**, so that I can manage reported crimes.
- As an **administrator**, I want to **view all reported crimes**, so that I can verify and take appropriate action.
- As an **administrator**, I want to **approve or reject reported crimes**, so that only legitimate crimes are shown publicly.
- As an **administrator**, I want the system to **automatically detect crime hotspots**, so that I can allocate resources efficiently.
- As an **administrator**, I want to **see clusters and heatmaps**, so that I can visualize areas with high crime rates.

## 4. Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interface (UI) Requirements

- Responsive web interface for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

#### Citizen Interface:
- Crime Reporting Form:
  - Dropdown for crime type
  - Description text area
  - GPS/manual map-based location selection
  - Image/video upload (optional)
- Interactive Map (Leaflet.js):
  - Map markers for individual crimes
  - Heat clusters for hotspots (â‰¥10 crimes in 1 km)
  - Filters by type/date
- Report Tracker:
  - Displays all submitted reports
  - Shows real-time status (Pending, Verified, Rejected)

#### Admin Dashboard:
- Table/list of reported crimes
- Filters for status, date, location
- Approve/Reject/Verify buttons
- Status colors:
  - Pending = Yellow
  - Verified = Green
  - Rejected = Red

---

### 4.2 Application Programming Interface (API) Requirements

- RESTful APIs using JSON format
- API Endpoints:
  - User Authentication (register, login, JWT)
  - Crime Reporting (submit, update, delete, fetch)
  - Crime Verification (admin-only actions)
  - Hotspot Detection (geo-clustering)
  - Analytics (crime trends, types, count)
- HTTPS enforced on all endpoints
- Role-based access control (Citizen vs Admin)

---

### 4.3 Hardware Interface Requirements

- Must support:
  - GPS modules (mobile/tablet)
  - Camera and file access for evidence upload
- Server compatibility:
  - AWS, GCP, Azure (cloud-hosted environments)

---

### 4.4 Software Interface Requirements

- Integrations:
  - MongoDB (geospatial queries)
  - Leaflet.js (map rendering)
  - Express.js (Node.js server)
  - JWT + bcrypt (authentication/security)
- Compatibility:
  - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
  - Node.js v18+
